# Secure by Scenario

Secure by Scenario is intended to provide a modular framework for tabletop pre-enactments of incidents requiring a response. The aim is for a lightweight core framework to support including modules for a variety of different incident types, industries, and responses, incorporating cyber security, broader security, business interruptions, disaster recovery, and others.

The core framework defines the end-to-end process for initiating, executing, and analysing a scenario test. The core framework is, by design, high-level and minimal without any domain-specific requirements. The framework also incorporates a shared syntax for labelling modules to assist users incorporating modules into a scenario exercise.

Any additional materials applying beyond the framework are contained in dedicated modules consisting of templates, materials, methods, and any other assets which can be included to enhance the core process but are not explicitly necessary.

# History

Secure by Scenario was the outcome of a multi-session track on threat modelling through to incident response scenarios at the Open Security Summit 2020.
