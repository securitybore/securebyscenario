## Discussion
- 09:11:20	 From  WallabyCurtis : James and Didar both have similar theme to their style today.
- 09:27:09	 From  Nick Drage : James makes an excellent point - the lack of adversary in these exercises is a typical omission, and also these exercises tend to be only aimed at management.
- 09:40:40	 From  Didar Gelici : gamification - work it with threat modelling - dungeon and dragons style, a dungeon master - randomness introduced by cards - fictitious  scenario on a fictitious company to avoid internal vengeance/politics -  randomise the roles in the teams as well, helps understanding different perspectives
- 09:43:19	 From  WallabyCurtis : Should we set up a GitHub for this to explore each of the areas and make it easier to discuss?
- 09:44:52	 From  Didar Gelici : scoping of the exercise very important - business continuity/resilience - safety vs security - incident response plan and test of that plan, required by your contracts or insurance policy -
- 09:45:47	 From  Didar Gelici : repeat exercises - until it becomes second nature
- 09:49:14	 From  Didar Gelici : and measure and announce the results to show to insurers, staff, management how you have improved
- 09:50:33	 From  Didar Gelici : limit the resources in the game to represent real life
- 09:55:46	 From  Didar Gelici : MVP for a war-game
- 09:57:38	 From  Didar Gelici : lockheed martin’s game thing showing controls and impacts
- 09:59:14	 From  Didar Gelici : game night for infosec
- 09:59:41	 From  Didar Gelici : OWASP cornucopia
- 10:00:50	 From  Didar Gelici : quarterly …?   monthly… ?
- 10:01:38	 From  WallabyCurtis : Monthly, that way if someone misses one, they wouldn't be waiting half a year, and we could get others involved.
- 10:01:57	 From  WallabyCurtis : Also, it will give others a chance to try out theirs.
- 10:02:26	 From  Didar Gelici : think about the pre-work too, people will prepare this on top of their day-jobs. Quarterly feels reasonable
- 10:03:36	 From  WallabyCurtis : Gradually blue team could block red team more and more unless red team comes up with zero days.
- 10:03:45	 From  WallabyCurtis : practical ones.
- 10:04:17	 From  Didar Gelici : open to all vs closed group exercises.  doing them in turns to get benefits from both styles
- 10:04:28	 From  Didar Gelici : Tech Leaders Club?
- 10:07:30	 From  Ben Schofield : https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats/advisory-2020-008-copy-paste-compromises-tactics-techniques-and-procedures-used-target-multiple-australian-networks

- 10:13:04	 From  WallabyCurtis : Types of attack, methods of attacks, and usage of attacks...
- 10:14:45	 From  WallabyCurtis : Design mode?
- 10:16:14	 From  Didar Gelici : get insights from other fields like marketing, in how to test things early in the design
- 10:16:27	 From  WallabyCurtis : Call it running scenarios?
- 10:16:56	 From  Didar Gelici  to  WallabyCurtis(Privately) : i don’t understand what you mean
- 10:17:07	 From  WallabyCurtis  to  Didar Gelici(Privately) : Secure by scenario.
- 10:17:32	 From  WallabyCurtis  to  Didar Gelici(Privately) : Not playing a game, but running a scenario.
- 10:17:37	 From  Didar Gelici : “Secure by scenario”
- 10:21:18	 From  Didar Gelici : modular, flexible - so people can fork and use
- 10:22:43	 From  Didar Gelici : James to create GitHub
- 10:22:56	 From  Didar Gelici : meet back in three weeks
- 10:26:21	 From  James Bore : https://github.com/securitybore/securebyscenario
