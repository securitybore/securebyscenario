# Post-Mortem of the Incident Exercise
## Chat File
- 09:11:20	 From  WallabyCurtis : James and Didar both have similar theme to their style today.
- 09:27:09	 From  Nick Drage : James makes an excellent point - the lack of adversary in these exercises is a typical omission, and also these exercises tend to be only aimed at management.
- 09:40:40	 From  Didar Gelici : gamification - work it with threat modelling - dungeon and dragons style, a dungeon master - randomness introduced by cards - fictitious  scenario on a fictitious company to avoid internal vengeance/politics -  randomise the roles in the teams as well, helps understanding different perspectives
- 09:43:19	 From  WallabyCurtis : Should we set up a GitHub for this to explore each of the areas and make it easier to discuss?
- 09:44:52	 From  Didar Gelici : scoping of the exercise very important - business continuity/resilience - safety vs security - incident response plan and test of that plan, required by your contracts or insurance policy -
- 09:45:47	 From  Didar Gelici : repeat exercises - until it becomes second nature
- 09:49:14	 From  Didar Gelici : and measure and announce the results to show to insurers, staff, management how you have improved
- 09:50:33	 From  Didar Gelici : limit the resources in the game to represent real life
- 09:55:46	 From  Didar Gelici : MVP for a war-game

- 09:59:41	 From  Didar Gelici : OWASP cornucopia
- 10:00:50	 From  Didar Gelici : quarterly …?   monthly… ?
- 10:01:38	 From  WallabyCurtis : Monthly, that way if someone misses one, they wouldn't be waiting half a year, and we could get others involved.
- 10:01:57	 From  WallabyCurtis : Also, it will give others a chance to try out theirs.
- 10:02:26	 From  Didar Gelici : think about the pre-work too, people will prepare this on top of their day-jobs. Quarterly feels reasonable
- 10:03:36	 From  WallabyCurtis : Gradually blue team could block red team more and more unless red team comes up with zero days.
- 10:03:45	 From  WallabyCurtis : practical ones.
- 10:04:17	 From  Didar Gelici : open to all vs closed group exercises.  doing them in turns to get benefits from both styles
